		<h1>Methodology</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>The basis of my project is to analyze the 2016 Democratic primary election results and their relation to black population, region, and urban-rural classification, all at the county level. All of the data I collected were from CSV files containing bulk data. I used the following datasets:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2016 Presidential Primary election results from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election">Kaggle</a>, a site that aggregates public data. I used Clinton's vote percentage for most of my analysis, with the assumption that Sanders receieved the balance of the remaining vote when considering the negligible amount of votes received by other minor candidates.</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/asrh/2014/CC-EST2014-ALLDATA.html">U.S. Census data</a> containing demographics (including race/ethnicity) for every county.</li> The dataset contains each county's total population, number of black males, and number of black females, which allowed me to calculate the percentage of African Americans in each county. It should be noted that my analysis is based on the overall population of these counties, rather than the populations of those who voted, but the overall county demographics will give us a sense of the demographics of voters in that county. 
			<li>A self-generated dataset indicating the region of the country (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West) for every county, as delineated by the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf">U.S. Census</a>.</li>
			<li>National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm">Urban-Rural Classification Scheme data</a>, which scores each county on a scale of 1 to 6 depending on how urban or rural the county is (1 being the most urban, 6 being the most rural).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Before analyzing the data and attempting to answer my research questions, I had to write a Python script to combine all of the data from the various CSV files into one workable dataset, so that each county in the U.S. was associated with values for Clinton's vote percentage, black population percentage, region, and urban-rural classification. First, I created four different functions that read in the data from each of the datasets and put the needed variables in a dictionary. I then defined a function that combined all of these variables from the four original functions into one dictionary, with the county name being the key. (The file containing the Python script used to aggregate the data is named 'combine_csv.py'.)</p>
		<p>To answer my research questions, I took the following methodological steps. (All plots and charts in the analysis were created in a Python file named 'plots.py', using the plotting library matplotlib.)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Generated a scatter plot which graphed each county's black population and Clinton vote percentage, and performed a regression on the relationship between those two variables.</li>
			<li>Determined how Clinton fared on average in each region of the country and generated boxplots showing the distribution of Clinton's county-by-county vote percentages in each region.</li>
			<li>Divided the counties into three separate groups depending on their black population. Counties with a black population of 20% or more were put into a "high-black" group, those between 10% and 20% were put into a "medium-black" group, and counties with a black population of less than 10% were put into the "low-black" group.</li>
			<li>Performed a controlled comparison analysis by generating a bar chart showing Clinton's vote percentage in "high," "medium," and "low-black" counties in each region.</li>
			<li>Determined how Clinton fared on average in more urban versus more rural counties by organizing the counties into six different groups corresponding with all six levels of the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme, and generated boxplots showing the distribution of Clinton's county-by-county vote percentages for each NCHS level.</li>
			<li>Performed a controlled comparison analysis by generating a bar chart showing Clinton's vote percentage in "high," "medium," and "low-black" counties for each NCHS level.</li>
		</ul>
