	<h3>Overall Relationship Between Black Population and Clinton Vote Percentage</h3>
	<p>The fundamental question at the heart of this analysis is whether there is, indeed, a relationship between the amount of African Americans in any given county, and that county's support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary election. The scatter plot and regression line below show the relationship between black population and Clinton's vote percentage.</p>

	<p>There is a clear positive correlation between black population and support for Clinton. The regression function, with Clinton vote percentage as the dependent varibale and black population as the independent variable, is as follows:</p>
	<center><p><b>Clinton vote pct = 0.40 + 0.81 * black pct
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.01)&nbsp;(0.03)</b></p></center>
	<p>The regression function tells us that if a county had a black population of 0%, that county would be expected to give 40% of the primary vote to Clinton. It also tells us that for any given county, a 10 percentage point increase in the black population is associated with an 8.1 percentage point increase in Clinton's expected vote percentage.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Differences by Region</h3>
	<p>How does Clinton's advantage among black voters differ by region of the country? First, let's take a look at her overall performance by region. The following boxplots show the distribution of Clinton's county vote percentages in each region.</p>
	<center><img src = "https://s3.postimg.org/rk3ph61j7/region_boxplot.png" width=600 height=425></center>
	<p>Clinton's performance was significantly better in the South than in any other part of the country. Although the boxplots indicate the median Clinton county vote percentage for each region, the mean Clinton vote percentages are similarly illustrative -- the average county in the South gave 59% of the vote to Clinton, compared to 39% in the Northeast, 36% in the Midwest, and 37% in the West.</p>
	<p>Now, let's look at Cinton's performance in each region with counties broken into three groups -- those with a high, medium, or low black population. Counties classified as "high-black" are at least 20% black, "medium-black" counties are between 10 and 20% black, and "low-black" counties are under 10% black.</p>

	<p>In a general sense, the results seem to map our expectations. For the most part, Clinton showed consistent improvement as the counties' black population increased, and as a whole, she did better in the South regardless of black population. The exceptions were (1) in the West, where there were no counties with a black population above 20%, and (2) in the Midwest, where although she did do better in "medium-black" (45%) than "low-black" counties (35%), her support dropped off in "high-black" counties (41%). This suggests some possible inroads by the Sanders campaign among black voters in the Midwest -- more research would need to be done to confirm this possibility.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Differences by Urban-Rural Classification</h3>
	<p>How did Clinton perform in urban vs. rural counties? The boxplot below shows the distribution of Clinton's county vote percentages within each level of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) urban-rural classification scale. The most urban counties have a value of 1 on the scale, while the most rural counties have a value of 6.</p>
	<center><img src = "https://s3.postimg.org/9ri59akar/NCHS_boxplot.png" width=600 height=425></center>
	<p>When looking at the median values of each NCHS level in the boxplot, we see a consistent decrease in Clinton's support as the counties get progressively more rural. In general, the majority of counties within the three most urban NCHS levels crossed the 50% vote percentage threshold for Clinton, while counties within the three most rural NCHS levels fell under 50%. The results show that Clinton did better in urban counties, while Sanders did better in rural counties. The boxplot also shows us that the distributions of county vote percentages widen as the NCHS level gets more rural as well. This means that the more rural counties were more varied in which candidate they supported.</p>
	<p>Now let's compare Clinton's vote percentage in "high," "medium," and "low-black" counties by NCHS level.</p>
	<center><img src = "https://s3.postimg.org/oyy4tnc5f/NCHS_barplot.png" width=600 height=425>></center>
	<p>An interesting finding emerges from our controlled comparison: as counties get more rural, Clinton's support decreases in the "low-black" counties, but increases in "high" and "medium-black" counties. In the most urban counties (where the NCHS level is 1), the amount of support for Clinton is fairly consistent, regardless of black population -- Clinton's vote percentage was 52% in "low-black" counties, 47% in "medium-black" counties, and 52% in "high-black" counties. As the counties get more rural (and the NCHS level increases), support for Clinton goes up in counties with a larger black population, while support for her goes down in counties with a smaller black population. In the most rural counties, Clinton won only 39% of the vote in "low-black" counties, while receiving 62% and 75% of the vote in "medium" and "high-black" counties, respectively.</p>
	<p>This adds a bit of depth to our earlier findings. Our previous findings showed that Clinton performed better among black voters, while Sanders performed better with rural voters. However, our new finding shows that Sanders's rural success was limited to counties with a small black population -- Clinton outperformed Sanders in rural counties with larger black populations. Similarly, though Clinton was largely more successful than Sanders in urban counties, Sanders was able to win significant support in urban counties with larger black populations.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>In the 2016 Democratic primary election, Hillary Clinton's county-by-county support increased as the black population of any given county increased. Our regression analysis showed that Clinton's vote percentage in a county was positively correlated with the percentage of African Americans in that county.</p>
	</p>Clinton's vote percentage was substantially higher in the South than in any other region of the country, regardless of the black population of the counties therein. While Clinton largely performed better in counties with higher black populations across all regions, her support did drop off slightly in "high-black" counties in the Midwest, which could point to inroads made by Bernie Sanders in those areas.</p>
	<p>Overall, the more rural a county was, the more likely they were to prefer Sanders over Clinton. However, in counties with a bigger black population, Clinton's support <i>increased</i> as the counties became <i>more</i> rural. In counties with fewer black residents, Clinton's vote percentage decreased as the counties became more rural.</p>
	<p>These findings could have an impact on Democratic electoral strategy as the party looks ahead to future primary elections. Clinton's overwhelming black support helped her win the nomination in 2016, and future Democratic hopefuls will need to gain the majority of black support going forward. Sanders and other like-minded candidates should look to expand on his rural success and aim to win a larger amount of black voters.</p>
